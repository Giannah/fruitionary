# fruitionary

This project is my proposal to the technical challenge: fruit-api.

Formatting is done with : [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Most styles come from the UI components library [Element +](https://element-plus.org/#/fr-FR).

Principal dependencies : [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to perform data fetching, [jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath) to retrieve only what's needed and nothing more :)
